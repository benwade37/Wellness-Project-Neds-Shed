# Wellness-Project
Wellness - Ned's Shed

Overview 

This is a project to boost awareness of Men's mental health problems and to offer a resource for men seeking help.
It does not delve too deeply into medical diagnosis or causes, but identifies with lonliness and offers access to one of the best 
medicines available: talking. With peers and other men. 

TOV 

The TOV is therefore light, the site was simply to identify with sufferers who need help and offers easy access to a solution. 
There are links for users to delve much deeper into the issues. This site is empathetic and therefore talking to users on their terms.
We are not speaking to psychologists or doctors here. It is perhaps a bit matey (and even a bit Cornish with the use of Ned) but that aligns to a lot of NHS comms too. 

What do we want users to do?

We want to enable users to simply find a support group of other men in their area - a shed - and also online. They can then tackle and share issues with others. They can also have access to social issues too. 

Initially at this stage, the users will have fill out a form to access the services. Later on in new phase, the plan is to make the network more acccessible. 

Notes: 2nd and 3rd pages are not implimented at this stage - this has affected testing.  There are going to be devoped later, a wireframe of the user journey and layout is provided below.

Deployment

The project was initially built using boiler plate on VS Code. The repository is hosted on GitHub, aswell as the project board. 

The website is also deployed directly from the Main branch of the GitHub repository, ensuring seamless updates and easy accessibility for users.

To Do:

I am still fitting in some missing code to enable features to work such as the form and the carousel and layout tidy ups. 
As I'm trying to keep up with CI KPis, this will be done on an adhoc basis. Hopefully completed by the 26th Jan.
