# Wellness-Project
Wellness - Ned's Shed

Overview 

This is a project to boost awareness of Men's mental health problems and to offer a resources for men afflicted.
It does not delve too deeply into medical diagnosis or causes, but identifies with lonliness and offers access to one of the best 
medicines available: talking with peers and other men. 

TOV 

The TOV is therefore light, the site was simply to identify with sufferers who need help and offers easy access to a solution. 
There are links for users to delve much deeper into the issues. This site is about empathy and talking to users on their terms.
We are not speaking to pschologists or doctors here. It is perhaps a bit matey (and even a bit Cornish with the use of Ned) but that aligns to a lot of NHS comms too. 

What do we want users to do?

We want to enable users to simply find a support group of other men in their area - a shed - and also online. They can then tackle and share issues with others. They can also have access to social issues too. 

Initially at this state, the users will have fill out a form to access the services. Later on in new phase, the plan is to make the network more acccessible. 

Notes: 2nd and 3rd pages are not implimented at this stage. There are going to be devoped later, a wireframe of the user journey and layout is provided below.
