            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Ned's shed. Is a real and virtual space where Cornish Men can talk. 

                We're men right? Cornish men. We're not meant to share our feelings right? Do we?
                Society expects us to deliver, and well, just to be tough.  And being in Cornwall, we're meant to be the toughest. Grrr! The elements and environment just demand it.
                
                So what happens if you've got something bottled up and you need to share it? Because we all know the meaning of 'it's better out than in'.  Well if you're looking for somewhere, you've come to the right place.</p>
